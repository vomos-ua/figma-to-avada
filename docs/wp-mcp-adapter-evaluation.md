# WordPress/mcp-adapter — evaluation (first-pass)

**Date:** 2026-05-13
**Status:** **SUPERSEDED.** See [`wp-mcp-integration-plan.md`](./wp-mcp-integration-plan.md) for the revised plan.

**Original decision:** NOT adopting for current pipeline. Use raw WP REST API + Application Passwords instead.

**Why superseded:** First-pass eval compared empty mcp-adapter vs raw WP REST API. Wrong comparison. The right one is **LP custom ability pack on top of mcp-adapter** vs **raw WP REST API per-project**. With LP's continuous Avada work, writing the ability pack once amortizes across all future client projects. See revised plan for details.

The technical facts below are still accurate. Only the recommendation flipped after reframing the use case.

## Repository

- https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter
- v0.5.0, 1,065 stars, 123 forks, actively developed (last push 2026-05-13)
- Owner: WordPress org (official), GPL-2.0
- Created: 2025-07-10

## What it is

PHP Composer package / WordPress plugin. Runs **inside** WordPress as an adapter for the WordPress Abilities API (`wp_register_ability()`, core since WP 6.9).

**It is not** a standalone Node server. **It is not** a generic WP REST wrapper.

## Critical finding: it has no built-in WP tools

Only 3 built-in abilities — all introspection:

- `mcp-adapter/discover-abilities`
- `mcp-adapter/get-ability-info`
- `mcp-adapter/execute-ability`

**Zero built-in tools for** create/update pages, upload media, set post_content, set post_meta, inspect existing content.

Verified by GitHub code search: `wp_insert_post`, `update_post_meta`, `wp_handle_upload` appear **0 times in PHP source**.

> **"It is plumbing, not a product"** — research agent verdict.

## Avada compatibility

**Zero Avada awareness.** Search for `avada`, `fusion_builder`, `fusion_builder_status` in repos `WordPress/mcp-adapter` and `Automattic/mcp-wordpress-remote` returns 0 results.

Critical Avada concerns:

- `_fusion` meta is a **serialized PHP array**. Any tool that writes Avada page meta must serialize correctly or Builder won't open the page in visual edit mode.
- `fusion_builder_status="active"` post_meta required for shortcode rendering.
- Unverified whether shortcode-only (without `_fusion`) gives editable page in Avada Builder or just front-end render.

## Realistic integration effort (if we adopted it)

~1-2 days of PHP work to write custom abilities:

- `lp/create-avada-page` → `wp_insert_post` + Avada meta
- `lp/upload-media` → `media_handle_sideload` (helper not built-in)
- `lp/set-fusion-meta` → `update_post_meta` with serialized `_fusion` array

Plus reverse-engineering Avada Builder's internal state model. None of this is shortened by mcp-adapter — it only saves the MCP transport layer.

## Pre-1.0 risk

- v0.3, v0.5 both had breaking changes (migration guides exist)
- Abilities API is core only in WP 6.9 (Nov 2025); older WP needs separate `wordpress/abilities-api` plugin which was **archived Feb 2026**
- More breaking changes likely before v1.0

## Better alternatives, ranked

### 1. Raw WP REST API + Application Passwords (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
POST /wp-json/wp/v2/pages
Authorization: Basic <base64(user:app_password)>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "PPC Landing",
  "slug": "ppc",
  "status": "publish",
  "content": "[fusion_builder_container]...",
  "meta": { "fusion_builder_status": "active" }
}
```

Pre-requisites for Avada meta in REST:

```php
// in child theme functions.php (one-time setup)
register_post_meta('page', 'fusion_builder_status', [
  'show_in_rest' => true,
  'single' => true,
  'type' => 'string',
]);
```

This is what `andreata/figma-to-avada` already uses. Zero plugins, 30-line Claude skill.

**Effort to adopt:** 1 hour. We already have App Password capability in WP admin.

### 2. wp-cli over SSH

```bash
wp post create \
  --post_type=page \
  --post_title="PPC Landing" \
  --post_status=publish \
  --post_content="$(cat shortcode.txt)" \
  --meta_input='{"fusion_builder_status":"active"}'
```

Most direct, requires SSH access to WP host. We have that on Hostinger.

### 3. mcp-adapter — only if scope expands

If LP later wants to expose **many** WP capabilities to Claude beyond Avada page creation (CRM-style reads, analytics queries, user management, etc.) — then mcp-adapter's abstraction starts paying off. For just "paste shortcode → create page", it's overkill.

## Decision

Phase B of original plan (automated WP integration) will use **raw WP REST API + Application Passwords**. Implementation:

1. One-time: register Avada meta keys in REST via child theme `functions.php`
2. Add `output/{site}/{page}/deploy.js` script: reads `shortcode.txt`, POSTs to WP REST API, returns page URL
3. Володимир sets `.env.local` with WP_URL + WP_USER + WP_APP_PASSWORD
4. Pipeline: extract → generate → deploy (one command)

Estimated effort: **half a day** vs 1-2 days for mcp-adapter integration with same end result.

## Phase B prerequisites (when we get there)

- [ ] WP App Password for Володимир
- [ ] Child theme already deployed (for `register_post_meta` snippet)
- [ ] Verify Avada Forms `form_post_id` can be read via REST (`/wp-json/wp/v2/avada_form` or custom endpoint)
- [ ] Media upload endpoint test (file size limits, MIME types)

For now (Phase 0-3 still in progress) — manual paste flow continues. No need to integrate WP automation until we have at least 3-4 working patterns.
